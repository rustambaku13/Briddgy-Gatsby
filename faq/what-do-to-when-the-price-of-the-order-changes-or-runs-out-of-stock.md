It is considered the best to purchase the order as soon as possible to prevent the cases when the price of order changes or it runs out of stock.

In case you face this issue contact the orderer as soon as possible. The orderer may send you a different like with similar price for you to buy from. If it was not possible, you can cancel the deal and specify the reason (incorrect price, out of stock etc.). 

Then, you may ask orderer to create new order with adjusted price and corrected link. 

If you have questions, do not hesitate to contact our support team ðŸ˜‰
