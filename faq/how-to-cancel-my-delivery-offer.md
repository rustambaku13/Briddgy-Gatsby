If you have offered an orderer to deliver the item but the orderer has not accepted it you can cancel the offer at any time without any consequences.  
If your offer has been accepted by the orderer, but the orderer hasn't paid for it yet, you still can cancel the offer.

If the orderer has already paid for the order you are committed to buying and delivering the item. If it is not possible to do, you can also cancel the deal, but it will have negative consequences on your traveler profile. Please keep in mind that several consecutive cancelations of paid orders can lead to the termination of your Briddgy account. We are doing it to keep the customers happy.
