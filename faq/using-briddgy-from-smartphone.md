<!-- Guidelines for making a new FAQ POST
 1. Everything inside **briddgy-faq-grid** class
 2. Use **col-2** and **span-2** classes to position elements in grid. NOTE: No need for col-1 span-2
 3. Use **<br/>** Tags for adding vertical space
 4. Wrap the text in a **<div></div>** To modify its styles
 4. Use **text-secondary** class for lighter text. NOTE: It will be added in the website
 5. Use **text-center** class for centering the text
 6. Use proper headings starting from H2. H1 is reserved for title
 7. You can always extend these styles but never make it opinionated about the design: That is never include font-sizes, colors, design elements in it.
