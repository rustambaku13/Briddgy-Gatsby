<!-- Guidelines for making a new FAQ POST
 1. Everything inside \*\*briddgy-faq-grid\*\* class
 2. Use \*\*col-2\*\* and \*\*span-2\*\* classes to position elements in grid. NOTE: No need for col-1 span-2
 3. Use \*\*<br/>\*\* Tags for adding vertical space
 4. Wrap the text in a \*\*<div></div>\*\* To modify its styles
 4. Use \*\*text-secondary\*\* class for lighter text. NOTE: It will be added in the website
 5. Use \*\*text-center\*\* class for centering the text
 6. Use proper headings starting from H2. H1 is reserved for title
 7. You can always extend these styles but never make it opinionated about the design: That is never include font-sizes, colors, design elements in it.

**Order with no risks.**

We have designed the platform in a way that protects the orderer from any fraudulent behavior. In case of not receiving your order, we will refund you.

Briddgy holds the payment received from the orderer. It is only released when the traveler hands the item and the orderer confirms the delivery of the specified order.

For your protection, we ask you to not use payment transaction systems other than Briddgy. In case that happens, we won't be able to protect you.    


**Didn't receive your order?**

Simply don't confirm the delivery and contact Briddgy. We will investigate the case and refund you the money for the order.
