title: How to hand off an order
topic: traveler
---
After buying an item and traveling to a destination city, you need to hand off it to the orderer. The meeting location is chosen through Briddgy Messenger by traveler and orderer.
We encourage our users to meet at public places for safety and security reasons.

Document the condition of the delivered item by taking its photo and keeps its receipt.
Also, make sure to remind the orderer to inspect the item and confirm the delivery on Briddgy. When the transaction is complete, Briddgy will send your payment to the bank account specified on the platform.

If you have questions, do not hesitate to contact our support team 😉

Thanks for being part of our community 🙏
