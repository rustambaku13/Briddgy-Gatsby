<!-- Guidelines for making a new FAQ POST
 1. Everything inside \\\*\\\*briddgy-faq-grid\\\*\\\* class
 2. Use \\\*\\\*col-2\\\*\\\* and \\\*\\\*span-2\\\*\\\* classes to position elements in grid. NOTE: No need for col-1 span-2
 3. Use \\\*\\\*<br/>\\\*\\\* Tags for adding vertical space
 4. Wrap the text in a \\\*\\\*<div></div>\\\*\\\* To modify its styles
 4. Use \\\*\\\*text-secondary\\\*\\\* class for lighter text. NOTE: It will be added in the website
 5. Use \\\*\\\*text-center\\\*\\\* class for centering the text
 6. Use proper headings starting from H2. H1 is reserved for title
 7. You can always extend these styles but never make it opinionated about the design: That is never include font-sizes, colors, design elements in it.

Briddgy's aim is to make the lives of travelers and people who want to order international (and not only) goods easier. It is achieved by connecting people who travel from one point of the earth to another with people who want to order something from the corresponding locations. 

This concept is known as **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)** delivery.\
As you may have understood, there are two parties interacting with each other on our platform. 

**Orderers** are one party. Orderers post their wished item on the platform and specify the details of the order (purchase location, delivery location, item price, delivery reward). You can see how it is done here - ([Briddgy | How to add Order](https://www.briddgy.com/faq/post/adding-order)). After posting it, Orderers will get **automatic suggestions** with suitable trips for their corresponding order. 

The second party on our platform is **Travelers.** Travelers post their trip details (origin, destination, free baggage space, date) on Briddgy.  You can see how it is done here - ([Briddgy | How to add Trip](https://www.briddgy.com/faq/post/adding-trip)). Here, similar to orderers, travelers will also get automatic suggestions with suitable orders for them to deliver.

Orderer will **get a notification** when the trip matching the order description is added to the platform. Similarly, travelers will be notified when an order with matching trip origin and destination is added.
