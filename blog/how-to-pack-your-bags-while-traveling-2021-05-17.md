Want to make money while traveling?ðŸ’¸ Deliver orders from Briddgy to a destination you travel to!ðŸ¤©

Follow the tips below to save space in your suitcase for more orders.ðŸ§³

1. Gather all the garments you anticipate needing, then put half of them back. Select clothes in the same color family, also pack more tops than bottoms.

2. Roll softer clothes and place them at the bottom of your suitcase first. Fold stiffer ones and place them in your middle level starting with the longest items. Finally, snake belts around the perimeter of the suitcase so they take up as little space as possible.

3. Follow the Rule of Three while packaging shoes: Consider one casual sandal, sneakers, and an evening shoe to be your holy trinity. Depending on how clean your shoes are, stuff them with other items like socks, sunglasses, and electronics chargers.

4. Never unpack your toiletries. Keeping a set of toilets already packed ensures that you donâ€™t forget any of the items that you might use the morning before takeoff.
